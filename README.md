# Design Philosophy

Totally speaking, in every task, **_the operation flow/process is unchanged_** and **_the only
changing thing is just the specific operation in each operation_**. (业务流程是不变的，变化的只是
具体的业务。)

Every artificial intelligence(AI) task involves four components: **Model**, **Data**, 
**Execution** and **Evaluation**.
