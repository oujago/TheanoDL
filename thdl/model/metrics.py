        This is useful for multi-label classification, where input samples can be
        classified as sets of labels. By only using accuracy (precision) a model
        would achieve a perfect score by simply assigning every class to every
        input. In order to avoid this, a metric should penalize incorrect class
        assignments as well (recall). The F-beta score (ranged from 0.0 to 1.0)
        computes this, as a weighted mean of the proportion of correct class
        assignments vs. the proportion of incorrect class assignments.

        With beta = 1, this is equivalent to a F-measure. With beta < 1, assigning
        correct classes becomes more important, and with beta > 1 the metric is
        instead weighted towards penalizing incorrect class assignments.
